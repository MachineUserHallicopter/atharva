<div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Microsoft Bob was a frilly, ornate software that spectacularly failed 
back in the 90s. The user was presented with images of various rooms<i> </i>cluttered with books, pens, clocks, calculators, letters<i>, </i>dustbins, calendars, boxes, shelves, cupboards, drawers, windows and a dog.<i> </i>Most
 of these opened a program in the computer that fulfilled the role 
roughly corresponding with the item you clicked. Except for the dog, 
which just talked. This virtual pooch assistant helped you navigate the 
messy rooms.<br></span><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/51d74ae1-a18a-479a-879f-51181cd29a1c" alt="image.png" style="margin-right: 0px;" width="558" height="419"><br><br></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Vincent
 Connare, who was a graphic designer for Microsoft at the time, was 
shocked by the font used in the gaudy mutt&#39;s speech bubble. It&#39;s a font 
that you are probably familiar with—<span style="font-family:times new roman,serif">Times New Roman</span>. Aghast by 
this stuffy, bureaucratic font colouring our furry friend&#39;s bubble, he 
set out to design a font that fits more fairly. A font I take pleasure 
in using.</span></div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><i>“</i>Comic Sans is a blight on the landscape of typography.” <br>- <span>Dave Combs, designer and co-founder</span><b> </b>of the Ban Comic Sans Movement<br></span></div></blockquote><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Comic
 Sans is uncanny and wonky. It has squiggly lopsided strokes, awkward 
spacing and goofy shapes. It stands out. Font choices were a luxury 
until word processors gave the masses access to a plethora of typefaces.
 Comic Sans was a popular choice when you wanted your text to appear 
friendly. As a kid, whenever I used Microsoft Word or similar software, I
 set the font to Comic Sans because that used to be the only fun looking
 and readable font in the dropdown menu back in the day.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Because
 of this accessibility, people overused this font, and in places where 
it did not belong—funeral invitations, war memorials, court documents, 
and notice boards. It became the poster child of amateur, tasteless 
application. Something about Comic Sans lent itself to being used with 
goofy clip art and <span style="color:rgb(255,0,255)">gaudy</span> <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255)">colours</span>.<br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/77723e68-0a59-42a3-8601-b529a4fa6677" alt="image.png" width="500" height="331"><br><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">I
 used to laugh at these uses of Comic Sans. But lately, my opinion has 
come around a bit. I often think about the time when Higgs Boson was 
discovered, a breakthrough in particle physics. The presentation that 
revealed this discovery was in Comic Sans.<br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/7b33447c-f075-442b-9c65-113501717f2b" alt="image.png" width="558" height="419"><br><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Fabiolla
 Gianotti, one of the leaders of the Higgs Boson experiment and the 
creator of the slide above was asked about her choice of using Comic 
Sans. Her response:</span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex"><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">Because I like it. It&#39;s so cute. As you see, I didn&#39;t change it [for the
 Hofstadter Lectures]. I find it a sweet and pleasant font.</span></div></blockquote><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">I
 found the lack of sophistication refreshing!! I can think of countless 
occasions where using this font for giving presentations or writing my 
reports in high school or college would have caused me problems :(</span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">People who go against the grain in appearance and 
&quot;taste&quot; while still being recognized for quality work have to be exceptional. 
They had more subtle resistances along the way and still found 
themselves in a successful place. It&#39;s the same reason why some VC firms
 report women founders outperforming their male founders—because those women 
had to be <i>exceptionally</i> good to make up for the sexism [1].</span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">The
 reason I want to incorporate more Comic Sans in my life is more in line
 with Vincent&#39;s vision—I want to fight the emphasis our society has 
placed on putting up stuffy and &quot;professional&quot; appearances that are 
inauthentic. I want people to be themselves. When I want to be goofy, I 
want to use Comic Sans. It&#39;s a cute and stupid font. I like it.<br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/9e27cb6f-18b9-4297-9bd7-b486657764fa" alt="image.png" width="558" height="198"><br><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">(an excerpt of a slide I had to give in a presentation at work. my colleagues aren&#39;t uptight, so it worked there :D)<br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif">[1] <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html" target="_blank">http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html</a></span></div></div></div>
