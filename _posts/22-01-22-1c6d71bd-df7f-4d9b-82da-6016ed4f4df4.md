I sit back on my revolving chair, and make my way down each layer of mortal, material thoughts to my default state of being <a href="https://internetblog.co/atharva/2021/10/26/bd886523-0058-462d-bd8b-8d4f1e545999.html" target="_blank">weirdly existential</a>. At this point, a thought appears. <br><div><br></div><div><i>Remember how it was like when you were a child?</i></div><div><br></div><div>In pop culture, remembering your childhood often revolves around the <i>what</i>. We like to remember what happened, in an accounting type of way, and we make notes of pivotal moments. But we rarely think about <i>how</i> it was like being a child. What was your mind like, especially in the mundane moments? Could I step into the headspace of my eight year old self?<br></div><div><br></div><div>I started playing this game in my head and realized something that I used to often do as a kid. It sounds bizarre when said out loud. I used to play games in my head, by myself. Let me explain.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Some prerequisites<br></b></div><div><br></div><div>My head games were driven by a few things in my environment. Firstly, this was back in the days when kids having phones were not even a thing. Nor were there corporations with the goal of creating a black hole for sucking in every second of your attention. This meant lots of hours of the mind being free and bored.</div><div><br></div><div>There&#39;s another thing that is obvious, but amazing when I actively think about it. Most neurotypical minds can do this weird thing. Open your palm and imagine a tiny penguin sitting on it. If your mind is like mine, you will have actually seen a penguin on your palm that isn&#39;t actually there. Sure, it&#39;s not as vivid and persistent as my normal vision, but the fact that I can put things in my visual field at will feels kind of awesome.<br></div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s all I need to make this work.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The games</b></div><div><br></div><div>I used to take the school bus every day. While I had bus-friends to talk to, I sometimes preferred grabbing the window seat to look outside and have some me time. I used to play two games there.</div><div><br></div><div>The first one is what I now call &quot;threading around cones&quot;. In driving tests or sports drills, there&#39;s a movement pattern where you alternately weave around cones (or similar obstacles).</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/0d516394-f490-483e-b43c-a9a9a16efea0" alt="image.png" width="578" height="385"><br><br>There was a lot of &quot;footpath&quot; breezing past my window as I looked out of the bus. The footpath had a ton of garbage and obstructions, which I used to treat like cones, and then visually draw a thread around the obstructions, as the bus whizzed ahead.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/4ca9f71c-4553-4d19-acec-24dc7c5b3d47" alt="image.png" width="434" height="578"><br>fig: &quot;threading around cones&quot;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another similar game was to imagine a tiny character (depending on the day, either a gingerbread man or Sonic the hedgehog) running along the bustling footpath and jumping on top of the biker&#39;s helmets and rooftops. It works better when you can add a sound effect of a hollow thunk every time the tiny character jumps on people&#39;s heads.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A game that I think is more common is the one with tiles. Often in apartment complexes and public places you see tiles with slightly randomized colours. Some tiles are dark and uncommon.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://internetblog.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1e17eb28-146d-4c50-a63c-ed40f6d45507" alt="image.png" width="578" height="434"><br>fig: the tiling game<br></div><div><br></div><div>This &quot;game&quot; has me mentally jumping a focus point from one dark tile to the next one as I walk along it. You can take it to the next level by actually jumping through the dark tiles. Watch out for lamp posts.</div><div><br></div><div>There was also a game which I played in school, as an alternative to actually paying attention to class. Well, <a href="https://atharvaraykar.me/education/lectures.html">boring lectures</a> seemed to induce a more ...morbid game in my head.</div><div><br></div><div>I used to imagine a terrorist/robber/serial killer walking in to a classroom, with a gun or knife, holding the class hostage (in hindsight, a perfect metaphor for what sitting in class felt like). The goal is to look for ways to get out safely. Where are the escape routes? Can I use the window? What objects in this room can make a good self-defense weapon? Is it worth being a hero to take down the evil person? I used to visualize all possible scenarios.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The things we lose when we grow up</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>I always had mixed feelings about being an adult. I wanted their independence and responsibilities. They don&#39;t have people taller than them holding them hostage everyday (not exactly true, but I was a na√Øve kid). But, adults also seemed so... bland. As though something died inside them. Their sense of wonder and curiosity was hammered away from them by society.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Me stopping my mind games was one part of me becoming an adult. Sure, the games were crude, but I never replaced them with anything equally absurd or imaginative. I just moved on to thinking about career, my future, or getting my attention pulled away by the myriad distractions set up by the digital age. But when I played the game of becoming an eight year old again, I found that fun (and absurd) side of me again. Turns out, the obligations of being an adult can coexist with childlike wonder. Try it sometime.<br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
